--------------------------NTP solusion---------------------- 

If Jetson Nano is connected to the internet, we can configure it to automatically update its system clock 
from a NTP(Network Time Protocol) server each time it boots. This can be done by setting the NTP service to start at boot time.
(Keep in mind that the NTP solution won't work if Jetson Nano isn't connected to the internet at boot time)

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ntp
sudo systemctl enable ntp
